### Summary:
I am working with a real experimental dataset provided by X5 Group, a russian food retailer \href[https://www.x5.ru/en/]. In the experiment, the retailer randomly chose a subgroup of the customer base and sent to half of it an SMS prompting them to perform some action. The customers are considered "treated", and the treatment variable is $T=1$. The other half did not receive any intervention ($T=0$, control group). The experiment is fully randomized, meaning that each customer had a 50% chance of being assigned to the treatment group ($e = 0.5$), regardless of their behavioral or demographic information. The response $Y$ captures whether a customer performed that action that was mentioned in the SMS and is binary ($Y \in \{ 0,1 \}$). The goal of the analysis is to identify the customer profiles that are responsive enough to make the intervention profitable. The customer profiles are summarised by a covariates vector $X$. The covariates have been  preprocessed and some feature engineering has already been conducted.
