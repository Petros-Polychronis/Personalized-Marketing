### Summary:
I am working with a real experimental dataset provided by X5 Group, a russian food retailer \href[https://www.x5.ru/en/]. In the experiment, the retailer randomly chose a subgroup of the customer base and sent to half of it an SMS prompting them to perform some action (treatment group). The other half did not receive any intervention (control group). The response $Y$ captures whether a customer performed that action that was mentioned in the SMS and is binary ($Y \in \{0,1}$). The goal of the analysis is to identify the customer profiles that are responsive enough to make the intervention profitable. The customer profiles are summarised by a covariatesvector $X$. The covariates we will have been  preprocessed and some feature engineering has already been conducted.
